# Donations

If you are looking for a way to support the project, and its entirely optional, this is my preferred approach. I am conducting a fundraiser to purchase a K1M printer, just so I can push out fixes and new features a bit faster, but also specifically test the K1M as well as the K1.

If you can't donate via go fund me directly, I have also added a kofi account.

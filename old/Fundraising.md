# Fundraising

If you are looking for a way to support the project, and its entirely optional, this is my preferred approach.   I am conducting a fundraiser to purchase an additional K1 printer, just so we can push out fixes and new features a bit faster.

If you can't donate via go fund me directly, I have also added a kofi account.
